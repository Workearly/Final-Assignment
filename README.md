# Final-Assignment
My solutionest of solutions: 

Roughly following the indicated steps,

1) booze_info.csv is the csv product of the given sql file using SQLWorkbench

2) The Jupyter notebook cells indicate the steps taken on the Python/Pandas part of the assignment fairly well. Notable difficulties would involve my lack of deeper 
knowledge concerning the Pandas library. I could probably make things much simpler had I known better. Nevertheless, not too difficult.

3) The final .csv file depicts the dataset containing the results of the analysis.

4) The two .png figures are the product of the Matlab related problems. Created using the above afore mentioned dataset. Results are satisfying contextually,
but do look like a proper mess. I had trouble figuring out how to assign unique colors to every zip-code in fig1 and I spent a whole lot more time than I 
should trying to figure out how to properly format the y-axis store names in fig2 in order to not overlap.


Final thoughts: all in all, this assignment would have cost a fraction of the time were we to use PowerBI; but personally, I prefer these clunky results to looking
straight at the blazing sun that is PowerBI's light mode interface.
